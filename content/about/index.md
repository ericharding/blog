My name is Eric and I think I might start a blog some day.

I'm a software engineer and have been programming professionally since about 2002.  I hope to make this site a place to keep notes about things that I'm learning and projects that I'm working on.  I have always enjoyed building tools for other developers but haven't been doing that as much the last few years.
