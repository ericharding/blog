Really enjoyed speaking at the [Southern Fried F#](https://southernfriedfsharp.com/) conference yesterday.  Its exciting to be a part of [The Triangle's](https://www.rtp.org/) first F# conference.

A huge thanks to all the other speakers who came. Particularly those who traveled to get here.
Looking forward to next year!

If you're local drop by the second Tuesday [F# meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-F/) and say hi some time.
