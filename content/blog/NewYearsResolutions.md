Ok... You might not believe this but, despite the date, I did **not** start this blog as a new years resolution.

I've been thinking of starting a blog for a while now but haven't taken the plunge.  Recently I joined a new [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-F/) for users of the F# language.  One thing led to another and somehow after meeting twice we're organizing an F# Technical conference next April (wait what? how did this happen. 😲). Technically, it hasn't been announced yet but neither has my blog so I feel like it's OK to put a link [here 🐔](https://southernfriedfsharp.com/).  

Anyway, I want to do a talk at the conference and I thought it would make sense to use a blog as a way to organize my thoughts on the topic that I want to speak on.  There was only one problem...
