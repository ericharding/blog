    ** This has some really good 'selling points'

    Are you a JavaScript developer? 
    Are you annoyed by every undefined is not an object? 
    Do you think static type checking makes your code slightly better? 
    Currently, there is a hype for a ReasonML. Do you want to be on the bleeding edge?
    Do you want to learn a new functional language? 
    Are you tired of fixing production bugs?

    Do you like the 'simplicity is a virtue' philosophy of Elm?
    Do you wish Elm had support from a huge corporation so it was easier to sell to your boss?
